                        <p>A bit about me: I'm an ex-public finance professional turned full stack web developer. Having always been curious about technology, I learned the ropes of Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Git via the Bitmaker Labs immersive web development bootcamp. I also hold a masters degree from the London School of Economics and an undergrad degree from the University of Toronto. </p>
                        <p>I love experimenting and making cool things, both on and off the internet. In my spare time, you can find me hacking away on a civic tech initiative, organizing a <a class="underline-link" href="https://twitter.com/railsgirlsTO"> Rails Girls TO </a> meetup, working on my latest DIY project, or playing volleyball with friends.</p>
